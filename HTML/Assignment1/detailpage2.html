				Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes
				ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987), is an Argentine professional
				footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris
				Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely
				regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a
				record seven Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European
				Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team.
				Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional
				career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies,
				including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four
				UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative
				playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474),
				most goals in a La Liga and European league season (50), most
				hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and
				most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa
				América (17). He also holds the record for most international goals
				by a South American male (90). Messi has scored over 780 senior
				career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a
				player for a single club. 
				<br> 
				<br> 
				Born and raised in
				central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at the
				age of 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October
				2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club
				within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season
				in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish
				football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three
				successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive
				Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four
				times and in a row.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he set the La
				Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season,
				while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The
				following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or
				behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before
				regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the
				all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic
				second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in
				2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he
				won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris
				Saint-Germain in August 2021.
				<br>

				An Argentine international, Messi holds the national record for appearances and is also the country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021.
