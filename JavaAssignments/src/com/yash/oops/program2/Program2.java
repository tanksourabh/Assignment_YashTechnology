 * 			Create class/interface Shape which will have only one
 *         method area. Create class Triangle, Square and Rectangle all will
 *         extends/implements Shape. In class Triangle, Square and Rectangle
 *         depending upon the number of sides you have to react the co-ordinates
 *         of the vertex. For example triangle having three vertex so name each
 *         vertex A,B and C. now you have to read the x & y co-ordinates of A,B
 *         and C, after that you have find the distance between the vertex A, B
 *         and C after this you have to calculate the Area and print Area. Same
 *         process will be applied while calculating area of Square and
 *         Rectangle.
